['About 1 in 5,000 people have Marfan syndrome, including men and women of all races and ethnic groups.','About 3 out of 4 people with Marfan syndrome inherit it, meaning they get the genetic mutation from a parent who has it.','Some people with Marfan syndrome are the first in their family to have it; when this happens it is called a spontaneous mutation.','There is a 50 percent chance that a person with Marfan syndrome will pass along the genetic mutation each time they have a child.','Because connective tissue is found throughout the body, Marfan syndrome can affect many different parts of the body.','Features of the Marfan Syndrome disorder are most often found in the heart, blood vessels, bones, joints, and eyes.','Some Marfan features – for example, aortic enlargement (expansion of the main blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to the rest of the body) – can be life-threatening. The lungs, skin, and nervous system may also be affected','Marfan syndrome does not affect intelligence.']
